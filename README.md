- Running the frontend part:
**Note:** To run the application correctly, the environmental variables, which due to the security concerns were not included in this repo, are needed. To obtain them, please reach the authors of this repo out.

To run the frontend part, at least 7 terminal tabs are required to be up.
In the first six ones, for each of the microfrontends present i.e. `auth-module`, `products-browsing`, `products-managing`, `user-settings`, `user-basket`, `user-order`, execute `cd` command and run `npm run preview`.
Then, in the last terminal tab remaining, type the following commands:
1. `cd Main`
2. `npm run dev`

If the application setup was correct, the web application should be available at `http://localhost:5173`.
